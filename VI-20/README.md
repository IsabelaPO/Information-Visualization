## How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to quickly launch the project using Python's built-in simple HTTP server:

1.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and use the `cd` command to move into the directory named `VI-20` that contains the project files **`index.html`**, **`script.js`**, **`style.css`**, the data file **`streaming_platforms.csv`**, and the library folder **`d3`**.

2.  **Start the Local Server:**
    Run the following command inside that directory:

    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```
    This starts a basic HTTP server, making the project available on **port 8000**.

3.  **Open in Browser:**
